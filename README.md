### Console-Finances

I was hired to analyse and manipulate to the profit/loss accounts and provide easily-decipherable data for the client.

## The Goal

The objective was to develop, in JavaScript, code which would pull the specific data out of a multi-dimensional array.

The required data was:
  
    - The total number of months provided
    - The total revenue within that time period
    - The average change month to month
    - The best month in terms of profit
    - The worst month in terms of losses

The secondary objective was to ensure that the code would still function should more data be added, and that it was commented in a way which enables other developers to take over if required.
